 Infrastructure: Infrastructure is up to the mark with regards to technical requirements. But, the lack of sports facilities and the small size of the campus would put-off some students. There is a volleyball court and a basketball court available. The same space is used for games like football and cricket. The canteen is satisfactory. The new girls hostel has a charming look and is very clean. Wi-Fi is available across the campus and in the hostel. Classrooms are satisfactory.
 
 Faculty: The course curriculum is the one sanctioned by SPPU as the college is affiliated to SPPU as of 2018. Faculty members cannot be grouped into a category as each professor has different strengths and weaknesses. Overall, it is a college of average professors with sporadic occurrences of teachers who are actually knowledgeable and teach well.
 
 Other: The college has PICT ACM Student Chapter, PICT IEEE Student Chapter, TEDx, PICT Pictorial Magazine, NSS, PICT MUN Club, Robocon Club, PICT Algorithms Club, and PICT Cubers Club, under which several events take place throughout the year.

 Infrastructure: The infrastructure of the college will only be the problem as there are total 5 buildings 2 of them are hostels and 1 is the office. So for studying, there're only 2 buildings. We have one basketball court and a volleyball court. The girls hostel is renewed and is better according to them. And old girls hostel is given to boys.

Saurabh Mohrir | B.E. in Computer Engineering - Batch of 2021,"Pune institute of computer technology review.
 
 Placements: Placement of PICT Pune is good for Computer engineering. For IT and ENTC its a average figure. Morgan stanley, Rakuten are hiring students on big package. Rakuten offers the highest package nearly 40 Lacs per annum and more than 70 students get salary higher than 5 Lacs per annum and TCS, infosys are mass recruiters. They offer 3 Lacs per annum. Internships usually offered in third and final year. As per my knowledge internships are good and upto 17000 you can get stipend. Placement Cell is good and it is improving placement, statistics year by year.
 
 Infrastructure: College campus is small it is approximately 5 acre. It includes mainly classroom buildings and girls and boys hostel. Classrooms are spacious. Labs are also good and well equipted. Library have many books and are well arranged for students. You have to return or renew book within 7 days but you can access library freely. There is reading room above library available for study. Canteen quality is not good and there many options other than canteen is available outside so don't worry about it. Hostel is expensive usually students take flat in group of 4-5 but if you want to take hostel then you may take but it is strict and restricted entry rules.
 
 Faculty: Guys for first year engineering it is very strict. They take all of your energy. Classes from 8-4 and 1 lab each day. All teachers are qualified and teaching is good. They teach as per SPPU syllabus and university guidelines. One teacher is for 67 students nearly that's normal. For first year you have only Techmax in your hands and after that in third year you have industry exposure. First year curriculum is good and include all engineering branches basic knowledge but it is only remembered for your online, and university exams No such interesting application is there.
 
 Other: Events are very less. Credenz is technical event. It is the biggest event. There are lot of competitions are there in coding. NTH is very good and you will enjoy that competition. There is art events like abhivyakyee also. Crowd is good. There are many students of bharti vidyapeeth also.

 Placements: This year we had best placements in our college. Previously most of students who were placed were placed at accenture or tcs only with less package. But this year our college jad placements from top companies with very good package. The highest packages offered were from morgan stanley in India and from rakuten in japan. Most of students from EnTC were also placed in niche (above 5lpa) for the first time. The highest package was ffom rakuten of 36lpa in Japan and morgan stanley 16.5 LPA. There are no internship chances in EnTC department. The department doesnot support you for internship. Placement cell is well maintained and supportive.
 
 Infrastructure: College Wi-Fi is available with decent speed. Labs are well maintained with good facilities. Library has good collection of reference books but not big one. There is no ground available in pict. Only basketball and volleyball court is available and one cricket practice NET is present. Canteen management has been changed this year and it too good compared to previous one.
 
 Faculty: Entc is best for its teaching staff. They teach you well but they are strict at the same time. Minimum attendance of 75 is compulsory at any cost or else you need to face some issues before submissions of your term. But you don't get any industry exposure. They just teach you. Course curriculum depends on university of Pune only.
 
 Other: Every year there is only one cultural events and two or more technical events where you can see many students from different colleges coming and they take part in competitions.

The highest paying company was Rakuten. The other big companies in the drive are Morgan Stanley, Avaya, Nvidia etc. So the highest package offered was 40 LPA, and the average package is around 5 LPA.
 
 Infrastructure: PICT campus is spread on an area of 6 acres (even too small for a school). College offers only 3 streams computer, IT, E&TC and has a decent infrastructure to fulfil the needs of these 3 branches. Wi-Fi is accessible all over the campus except in classrooms. Labs have plenty of instruments, sufficient for a batch of 20. The library has a good collection of every required book. College does not offer much for your thirst for sports, only a basketball court for outdoor games, 1-2 table tennis tables for indoor are available. Canteen is the worst, I have to have a mess outside.
 
 Faculty: Leaving a few who really have in-depth knowledge of the subjects, the rest of the faculty only read out PPT slides. In the 3 years, I didn't learn much here. The college has strict rules for everything. I feel like it's another school after 12 years of school. If you want to only mug up the subjects and don't want to learn the real things, then come and join us.

 Faculty: Some of the faculty members are really good at teaching. Some of them do not have the knowledge, but still, they teach. The student-faculty ratio is good enough.

 Infrastructure: I can say that infrastructure is average like the equipment for practices are old because, its very old college, but they are improving. I can say about the infrastructure, the buildings are very attractive and beautiful views are there, but there is only one problem that the college is situated near the road due to which there is some disturbing environment.
 
 Faculty: The teaching staff is well-qualified overall. The teaching and learning process is very good.

The MNC companies such as Rakuteen, Morgan Stanely, TCS, Accenture, Atos and many more. Roles offered are Developer, Marketing sector, and many more. The student who want internship must talk to the staff of department. There is a Placement cell in the college which will help you during the placement for the necessary announcement. The stipend that college student has got may be 10 thousand per month during their internship. The placement will be done as per the criteria of the company but most of the companies are MNC that's why they require the first class student that means you must have 60% or above then only you are eligible for the company otherwise you are not. There are companies which will be of no criteria that will take the students who else having below 60%. During placement the students must have to take efforts for getting selected.
 
 Infrastructure: The college infrastructure is well and good. The classroom are good. The labs are also well maintained each and every instrument is properly arranged and placed. The college has its Wi-Fi also but you have to register to get the access of Wi-Fi. The library is not so big but essential for those who want to study in library. The library has lots of books for the students I. e, technical as well as non technical. The college has the medical facilities and also the sports but the college don't have the big ground.

Rohan Singh | B.E. in Computer Engineering - Batch of 2017,"Good placements. Average faculty, facilities and infrastructure.
 
 Placements: Placements are good specially for computer and information technology branch students with average of more than 4 lkhs for like 450 students. Top 100 students regularly get more than 7 LPA. Maybe 60-70 students remain unplaced due to lack of interest in placement drive or low marks. Placement cell is very supportive. You won't see many colleges Working that hard for bringing companies to colleges.
 
 Infrastructure: Infrastructure is good if you look in terms of academics. The major downside is we don't have enough space for recreation and sports. We only have one basketball court which is generally brimming with student groups all day. Apart from that all departments have been given enough space for laboratories for different subjects. Canteen is good and it's food is also good.
 
 Faculty: Teachers are very helpful but here attendance matters. Our college gives more emphasis on attendance and theoretical knowledge Rather than practical one. But there are some teachers who can go to any extent for helping you out - either with projects or academic related assignments.

The training and placement cell is very helpful, and the criteria for most of the companies is that students should have 60% aggregate.

Vaibhav Lohani | B.E. in Information Technology - Batch of 2018,"Good college for learning and getting a good job.
 
 Placements: Placements were really nice for 2018 batch. A lot of first time visiting companies, most of which are exciting startups visited. Examples can be rackware, ryusi etc. Companies that have been visiting earlier also visited. Almost 70 - 80 % of the students have been placed. Types of roles mainly offered were ( in order of frequency)- software developer/engineer, programmer, business analyst, technology analyst. For a surprise, marketing and sales roles also offered by some companies like byjus and wisdmlabz. Internships provided by the college are not very much. Most of the students look for internships on their own. For 2018 batch, Nvidia and ACI were the only companies that visited for internships, in which some 4 -5 students got internships. The highest package in India was 16 LPA by Morgan stanley and outside India 35 - 40 LPA in japan by Rakuten. Placement cell is present. Now, its efficiency and working depends on the very people running it. This year, the cell was very efficient, managed to attract many companies, and was also managed very efficiently. This can be attributed to the change of leadership and proactive volunteer. The cell is run by volunteers from our batch only. So it depends on them, and so its efficiency can vary every year.
 
 Infrastructure: Infrastructure of the college is average to above average. The basic infrastructure like classrooms and labs are very good. They have good quality computing resources for normal learning (however, they can sometimes be inadequate in final year for large projects). The Wi-Fi provides very good connection speed, but their can be some connection glitches, which are being worked out though. The quality of food in canteens has improved from this academic year (2017) after the caterer was changed. I was a localites, hence can not comment on hostels. Sports is, however, is an area where the college lags. Apart from a basketball and a volleyball court, there is nothing much. Also, the atmosphere here is kind of studious or geeky. So, if you are interested in sports, this is not the best place to be.
 
 Faculty: Teachers vary greatly and you will find each and every kind of teachers. So, it is a difficult thing to generalize. Mostly, teachers are helpful in comp and it departments. Entc department teachers are a little bit strict. Teaching quality is average to good. Teaching is mostly on boards and projectors. The course curriculum is good for building the base of knowledge. The basic and older (some students feel) technologies are more focused. But you will have to learn the latest trends by yourself. The self learning environment is also very good in college. Students can learn a lot is interest groups, events and other such activities where they can interact and develop projects with seniors. A lot of students learn competitive programming as well in these groups.
 
 Other: Many events take place across the year, catering to different interests. Most are technical events, some are cultural. Crowd in the campus is average. College does not provide its own bus for connectivity. So, you will have to use public transport or your own vehicle. Campus surroundings are mostly flats that are accommodated by college students. As bharti vidyapeeth university is also in vicinity, there are a lot of students living in that area and hence a lot of shops and services to serve their interests.",2018-03-25,Shiksha,good college learning getting good job placement placement really nice batch lot first time visiting company exciting startup visited example rackware ryusi etc company visiting earlier also visited almost student placed type role mainly offered order frequency software developerengineer programmer business analyst technology analyst surprise marketing sale role also offered company like byjus wisdmlabz internship provided college much student look internship batch nvidia aci company visited internship student got internship highest package india lpa morgan stanley outside india lpa japan rakuten placement cell present efficiency working depends people running year cell efficient managed attract many company also managed efficiently attributed change leadership proactive volunteer cell run volunteer batch depends efficiency vary every year infrastructure infrastructure college average average basic infrastructure like classroom lab good good quality computing resource normal learning however sometimes inadequate final year large project wifi provides good connection speed connection glitch worked though quality food canteen improved academic year caterer changed localites hence comment hostel sport however area college lag apart basketball volleyball court nothing much also atmosphere kind studious geeky interested sport best place faculty teacher vary greatly find every kind teacher difficult thing generalize mostly teacher helpful comp department entc department teacher little bit strict teaching quality average good teaching mostly board projector course curriculum good building base knowledge basic older student feel technology focused learn latest trend self learning environment also good college student learn lot interest group event activity interact develop project senior lot student learn competitive programming well group many event take place across year catering different interest technical event cultural crowd campus average college provide bus connectivity use public transport vehicle campus surroundings mostly flat accommodated college student bharti vidyapeeth university also vicinity lot student living area hence lot shop service serve interest

 Placements: Placements are actually good compared to other colleges, even COEP. If you want to give interview of every company, just crack the criteria, that is average percentage of all four years. E&TC students can also sit for placements of almost every software company. E&TC placements were not so good until this year. Almost 50+ students got package above 5LPA. Comp and IT placements are always good. And college is taking autonomy from 2018 which will be beneficial. The highest package this year was 42LPA by a Japanese company Mercari. Rakuten also gives packages around 30LPA. Other companies visiting PICT are : Morgan Stanley, Avaya, ittiam, eq technologies, quick heal, Ola, Byju's, FinIQ, HSBC, etc. Deutsche bank also visited this year. You can see placement report of every year on website pict. Edu. Frankly speaking, core electronics companies are Less in number. So electronics students have to go through software companies interviews and compete CS IT students, which they are doing well. We don't get internship for college. Students have to look for them for almost every college. Thank you.
 
 Infrastructure: Frankly speaking the college area is very small compared to every college, even school. But it is kept very clean and neat. Hostels have less rooms but are also good. Don't get depressed after seeing the campus area of our college! Wi-Fi is available in campus and in hostel rooms with good speed. Labs have many equipments, you can perform every experiment that you are learning. Classrooms are like school classrooms, desks are small!

Some have degree of IIT's and have Ph.D. in respective subjects. Some are pursuing Ph.D. HoD's and principal are strict but are very respected ! Yes, we do have industrial visits from second year. 6-7 teachers are there for each subject. Student to faculty ratio is almost 40 : 1. We do have ACM local chapter and IEEE.

Ashutosh Upadhyay | B.E. in Computer Engineering - Batch of 2018,"The college is good with the great placements.
 
 Placements: The placements were much better this year as compared to the previous years. The best part is, at the end of the year, the whole placement statistics are available on the website, and the statistics are totally genuine. The average package this year would be around 6 to 8 lacs per annum and the percentage of placed students may be around 70%.
 
 Infrastructure: The facilities provided in labs are top notch and no complaints whatsoever. The library provides a decent collection of books and journals. The college campus does not have ground for football, cricket, but still, the management makes proper arrangements for respective teams and players to practice. The quality of food in the canteen has been progressive over the four years.
 
 Faculty: Most of the teachers are very qualified, but somehow, they always tend to dominate the students. Hence, the students are sometimes forced to do pressurised work.

Utkarsh Singh | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2018,"One of the best college in Maharashtra for CE/IT/E&TC.
 
 Placements: The students from CSE and IT shouldn't expect anything more, and this is the best you can get. But if you are E&TC student, it is satisfactory, and still, one of the best college in Maharashtra. You don't get many options for core in E&TC companies. If you are willing to join IT industry, just close your eyes and go for it.
 
 Infrastructure: The campus is not very big, but if you look ATIT as a 3-branch college, it's enough, but that's just for studying purpose. There are not many facilities for sports and the other extracurricular activities. We have enough classrooms and labs with all the technologies you need. The only area where the infrastructure lagging is sports and games.
 
 Faculty: PICT has the best faculty members in Pune. The ratio is 15 students per teacher has been constant for a long time. The course is a bit tough as you have to study one subject from different stream definitely and these subjects are not the easiest ones. The internal marks are not just for granted, and you need to work hard for it.

Class and labs are well maintained obviously. The college is small hence only indoor games such as carrom, TT, chess, facility is available along with basketball and badminton and handball ground. This year the whole canteen contract is change, therefore new caterors are providing good quality food. All kind of food is available except Non - veg. Gym facility is also available for all in the evening. Since college being small in area, there is small space for students to play and enjoy and have fun in evening.
 
 Faculty: PICT is known for its quality education and placement of students with best packages, all credits goes to the teachers for there guidance and help. Here teachers are very qualified and only experienced teachers are present. Teachers teaches in the language with which students are comfortable, no compulsion of English. Teachers use old traditional method of teaching on blackboard along they use projector and PC method. In labs, all teacher use projector and digital methods to teach and they don't leave teacher until he gets the concepts and the student is able to explain. In class 1 teacher for 70 students and in lab 2 ( teacher + lab assistant) for 20 students. Various industry expert visit to share there experience but no Industrial Visit is provided by college. Course curriculum is never sufficient hence this college always emphasis on extra practical /industrial knowledge which they provide by giving access to digital library and online video lectures.
 
 Other: Along with education, there are technical fest every semester and one cultural event in a year. Campus crowd is good. There is bus stand and auto stand right in front of college and also another bus stand in 1 km range.

Saurabh Jadhav | B.E. in Information Technology - Batch of 2019,"Best for the passionate software engineers.
 
 Placements: Probably, this college is the best known in Pune. The companies provide max salary package of 36-38 LPA. The lowest salary is of 4.5 LPA. You get the internship call just by cracking the aptitude test. All branches have the placement record of 85-90% means every student with no backlogs will get recruited. In case of Off-course, you need to do some preparation, but follow seniors guidelines they will lead you to glory.
 
 Infrastructure: The college infrastructure is okay, and I mean average. Like you are not allowed to use the lifts, but that's not a point of issue. Wi-Fi- service is the best with speed around 600kb to 1.2 Mb, and with the limit 4GB per day of maximum usage. Drinking water with two-three filters per floor and all are maintained clean. Most cleaned campus, you can see the peon, cleaning the campus anytime. New canteen is good, but who has time for it, We have mini FC road in front of our college. The labs are very good and updated every classroom have good benches made in college itself and projector. Reading the hall, it is sometimes get filled during the exams where you have to find another way to study. Librarians are little rude, but you get three books including academics and non-academics for eight days without any cost. IEEE page is freely accessible. Our college is good at fascinating tech events. There is a little bit lack in the sports and gym, we don't have time for that, but college has good players, and provides resources on time. Even though the infrastructure is small and no ground life in college is good and charming.
 
 Faculty: Here comes the main part, people might think it is very reputed college which means the teacher might be excellent in teaching, and that's a rumour don't believe in that. Very strict in FY, then strictness level goes down up to BE and ME. You get better than average teaching staff, but more than 60% of the teachers are just excellent. The faculty is totally teaching in English, but all are Marathi or Hindi, so don't hesitate to ask anything. Overall, the nature of the students and staff are cooperating. The student to the faculty ratio is around 15:1, but not very sure. The teaching varies according to every teacher.

 Placements: The highest placement is around 30 LPA by Rakuten and Morgan Stanley. The other major placements are by Avaya, Veritas, etc. The average placement by Pune Institute of Computer Technology is 5-6 LPA. This year, a student from IT department got a package of 48 LPA by Rakuten (off-campus).
 
 Infrastructure: There is a separate building for each department, i.e. computer, IT, EnTC and applied science. There is a sports room, gym, and a college canteen and mess. The boys hostel and girl hostel have 43 rooms each accommodating 3 students in each room. There is a basketball court and a volleyball court and table tennis rooms.
 
 Faculty: The teaching staff is one of the best faculty members in Pune. From the first year to the fourth year, the teachers allotted have more than the required amount of knowledge.

Rucha Deshmukh | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2018,"Good placements, good infrastructure, Overall Good College.
 
 Placements: The placements for my batch have improved tremendously compared to the earlier batches. The earlier already had a good number of companies coming in for campus recruitments, but for our batch the number of companies have increased. In addition now there's scope for EnTC students to get placed in core companies rather than IT, if they wish. One thing to be noted is our college follows a one company policy.
 
 Infrastructure: Infrastructure in our college is good where academics is concerned. There is not much scope for sports as we have only one basketball court. But, the college does encourage students to participate in inter college sports events. The canteen and hostel facility has improved in our college.
 
 Faculty: The faculty in the Electronics and Telecommunication Dept. Is knowledgeable and sincere. The teaching quality in the dept is good. Discipline is expected from the students. Teachers are regular and expect us to be the same. They are very well qualified. All teachers are extremely helpful.

Rohan Bhagat | B.E. in Information Technology - Batch of 2016,"Overall, it is a good college to study.
 
 Placements: The placements were good enough. 80 percent of the students were placed at least in IT. The highest package received was 32 LPA, given by a Japanese firm. Morgan Stanley, which is an investment banking company, offered Rs. 16 LPA. The lowest salary was 2.5 LPA and the average salary offered is around 3.5 LPA. I'm giving you this data for the academic year 2015-16, while previous year's placement records can be fetched from the college website. Companies like Avaya, Amura, Symantec, Searce, IBM, Accenture, TCS, Diebold, Sungard and many others visited. Most of the roles offered were programmers and in testing. Those who applied for internship from outside got the internship. Our college didn't provide it. I can't say about the stipend offered during the internships. Also, some of the groups approached companies, for sponsoring their final year projects. We have a placement cell. It is useful for providing the information about the upcoming companies and their process of recruitment. It will also conduct a mock written test, GD and PI to get students an idea of the recruitment process.
 
 Infrastructure: Wi-Fi is present all over the campus. The labs are equipped with great PCs. The classrooms have projectors and are well maintained. The library consists of thousands of books which comes in handy if you are eager to learn. Overall, the quality of labs, classrooms, and library is well maintained. You'll find them neat and very clean. We have a medical doctor on the campus. The college canteen is not good, but you'll find many restaurants and snacks centres in front of the college. College hostel is present inside the campus and is well maintained, and it has a separate Wi-Fi. You have only one main building in the entire campus in which all the three branches, that is, computer, IT, and E&TC are present. The new building was under construction. But it is not a spacious campus, it is very small.
 
 Faculty: The teachers and faculty members are qualified and are knowledgeable. But, the teaching methods of some of them is not good. You won't understand anything, and you'll have to study yourself. Teaching methods include presentations, theoretical knowledge in class and practical knowledge in labs. Student to faculty ratio is good but not that good. I think my college needs to hire some faculty members. We had an industrial visit in the third year. The course curriculum is useful for the students to enrich the knowledge required for the IT industry.
 
 Other: We have a technical fest Impetus and Concepts, which is one of the best tech fests in Maharashtra. If you like coding and if you want to have other technical skills, you'll love this fest. We have an annual 4-day function, with first three days having a different theme like a traditional day, Halloween day, rose day, mismatch day etc. The campus is surrounded by many food centres and restaurants. Lots of private hostels are present. You can also rent an apartment in the price range Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 15,000. Extracurricular activities include basketball, table tennis, carrom, chess, volleyball and cricket. We only have a basketball ground in which we also play cricket and also volleyball. Since it is a small campus, we had to do that. In the clubhouse building, we have a gym, two tables for table tennis and carrom boards. Since the college is strict in many ways such as attendance, assignments and practical exams, I would not recommend this college to a student who wants a social and fun-loving college. PICT has fun in a nerdy way. So if you're up for a nerdy life and good placement, go for it. You can also get a scholarship or free ship if you apply for TWFS, for which you have to have a good score in the entrance exam or if you are from SC/ST/OBC categories.",2018-02-16,Shiksha,overall good college study placement placement good enough percent student placed least highest package received lpa given japanese firm morgan stanley investment banking company offered r lpa lowest salary lpa average salary offered around lpa im giving data academic year previous year placement record fetched college website company like avaya amura symantec searce ibm accenture tc diebold sungard many others visited role offered programmer testing applied internship outside got internship college didnt provide cant say stipend offered internship also group approached company sponsoring final year project placement cell useful providing information upcoming company process recruitment also conduct mock written test gd pi get student idea recruitment process infrastructure wifi present campus lab equipped great pc classroom projector well maintained library consists thousand book come handy eager learn overall quality lab classroom library well maintained youll find neat clean medical doctor campus college canteen good youll find many restaurant snack centre front college college hostel present inside campus well maintained separate wifi one main building entire campus three branch computer etc present new building construction spacious campus small faculty teacher faculty member qualified knowledgeable teaching method good wont understand anything youll study teaching method include presentation theoretical knowledge class practical knowledge lab student faculty ratio good good think college need hire faculty member industrial visit third year course curriculum useful student enrich knowledge required industry technical fest impetus concept one best tech fests maharashtra like coding want technical skill youll love fest annual day function first three day different theme like traditional day halloween day rose day mismatch day etc campus surrounded many food centre restaurant lot private hostel present also rent apartment price range r r extracurricular activity include basketball table tennis carrom chess volleyball cricket basketball ground also play cricket also volleyball since small campus clubhouse building gym two table table tennis carrom board since college strict many way attendance assignment practical exam would recommend college student want social funloving college pict fun nerdy way youre nerdy life good placement go also get scholarship free ship apply twfs good score entrance exam scstobc category

 Faculty: The faculty are one of the best in Pune. The faculty are always there to help the students to clear their doubts. They do cooperate with the students. Although they are sometimes a way too strict in terms of attendance, that is due to college's policy and university guidelines.

Kshitij Kucheria | B.E. in Information Technology - Batch of 2018,"Great college life, if you know what to export and focus upon then join this college.
 
 Placements: One of the best colleges in Pune, if the placement is the only factor you take into consideration. The average package offered was CTC 8.33 LPA this year up to now, and what more do you want. The training and placement cell has a record of placing students appropriately according to their capability, but you must make a smart choice depending on your interest and expected pay due to the one-job policy.
 
 Infrastructure: The college infrastructure is good and has been developing a lot recently. All the labs have good facilities, and there are well-equipped classrooms. The new girl's hostel construction has completed recently. The canteen has good space and is pretty decent. There could be a better auditorium and ground, but the ones present are not that bad.
 
 Faculty: The course curriculum which is followed by both Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Engineering is under the Savitribai Phule Pune University which I guess need to be updated. Also, if all the requirements in the curriculum are as practical as when required, it is a decent one. The college will be an Autonomous Institute from the next academic year which means positive changes are yet to happen here. Most of the faculty is good and helps if you are interested in academics but won't in literally anything apart from that.
 
 Other: The college is in the Bharati Vidyapeeth Blackmarket. This area is very good to live in, and the campus offers access to various food joints nearby. It is easy to get accommodation and good food in the campus area without spending a lot of money. The people from the nearby colleges, VIT and Sinhagad, come here for reasonable food. The college crowd in PICT is excellent. You will get all kind of people to live and make friends around. The people here are from good backgrounds, making it one of the best crowds for a college environment.

 Placements: The placements are very good here. Around 85-90% of the students among all students get placed. The highest package offered is 36 LPA. The lowest package offered is 3-5 LPA. The average salary for niche companies (Salary above 5.0 LPA) is around 8 LPA and for variant recruiters (Salary Below 5.0 LPA) is above 3 LPA. Companies visited our campus are Morgan Stanley, Avaya, EQ Technology, Ittiam, Symantec, Rakuten, UbiSoft, HSBC, Adobe, Microsoft, Cadence and lots of other companies come here. The roles offered to the students were software engineer, trainee, software developer and hardware developer. PICT have a very efficient placement cell.
 
 Infrastructure: The college provides good facilities like Wi-Fi, labs, classroom, library, and medical facilities. But, no playground for sports purpose. It is a very small college. Only 7 buildings are there, computer department, FE department, IT & ENTC department, Postgraduate Department and a central library, boys hostel, girls hostel, canteen and indoor games room. The quality of labs and classrooms are very good, clean and well maintained. Quality of food available in the canteen is average. The hostel rooms are neat and clean. I didn't face any infrastructure related issues.
 
 Faculty: The teachers are well qualified, veterans, knowledgeable, and very helpful. The teachers also do hard work to convey knowledge to the students. Very effective and good quality of teaching is provided. The course curriculum is useful, they give you education as good as you expected. There is no industry exposure. The student to faculty ratio is fine, 20:1.
 
 Other: The events are very poor. The non-technical events are nothing compared to that you imagine. But, the technical events are very awesome. The campus crowd is not much.

Suyog Rokade | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2016,"One of the best engineering colleges in Pune.
 
 Placements: It is the best college for the placement. One can easily get placed if he gets good marks. Prefer IT and computer over ENTC. The faculty members are helpful in providing good placement, and Pune Institute of computer technology is among the most popular and most exciting colleges in Pune.
 
 Infrastructure: The labs and buildings are good. Not a big campus. The hostels have a low intake. One can find the place tiny as college's playground and other area is small. But Bharti Vidyapith is near to roam around, and you will get all the connectivity to the college without any problems.
 
 Faculty: It is a good college according to me. The faculty members are very good and well-established ones. You won't feel like you are running out of guidance for your course. Even the lab assistants are well-educated and helpful in almost every scenario. You can bet on the college's curriculum at any time.

Mayuresh Warade | B.E. in Information Technology - Batch of 2020,"Good placement provided. Teachers are good and helpful. Competitive atmosphere.
 
 Placements: The placements provided are good. Last year, they were better than COEP. Almost 75% of the students get placed. The college gives higher priority to the placements over the curriculum. But the attendance gives a headache to all the students. At least, the final year students get the time to complete their project work.
 
 Infrastructure: The college has four blocks. Now we have a new infrastructure for the girl's hostel. Maybe they are not as big as you think but it has only one basketball ground. There is a good parking lot for the students and the necessary facilities. The labs are still working on Pentium 2 processor. The entire campus is quite peaceful.
 
 Faculty: The faculty is very strict. 75% attendance is mandatory. It is based on Savitribai Phule Pune University's curriculum. But it is going to become an autonomous institution from the next year. The faculty members give more assignments to the students, but that is good for keeping a good score in the exams.

Anmol Bora | B.E. in Computer Engineering - Batch of 2018,"The best for computer engineering in Pune, the best placements, and an outstanding experience.
 
 Placements: The placements are one of the biggest plus points of PICT. This year, all the previous records were broken with more than 300 students placed in nice companies (minimum 5 LPA CTC). Last year, almost 85% students got placed in campus placements, but, this record might as well be broken this year. I am sure that the placements will further increase in the coming years.
 
 Infrastructure: People might say that PICT is smaller when compared to other colleges. Actually, it is enough because PICT offers only 3 branches. Recently, a research lab consisting of 50+ computers was inaugurated where we can carry out our projects. These computers contain GPUs which are required for faster processing. A new hostel was built for girls which I am sure is loaded with facilities. Wi-Fi is accessible anywhere on the campus. The canteen is good and pretty affordable.
 
 Faculty: I can speak for the computer department. All the professors I have come across are quite friendly. Because of the 75% minimum attendance policy, we have to attend lectures. These lectures are interesting as professors make use of videos to explain a difficult concept. Most of the teachers are pursuing PhD which is very helpful for the students who need a letter of recommendation in future. Various seminars and workshops are arranged by the professors which greatly influence the students.
 
 Other: One of the best event in Pune, Credenz, is organised by PISB (PICT IEEE student branch). Almost 10,000 students from/outside Pune attend the event.

Ashish Mokashi | B.E. in Computer Engineering - Batch of 2018,"Guarantee of placement, great study environment and exposure to various technologies.
 
 Placements: The placement cell is very hard-working, and they care about the students. The highest package offered is around 20 LPA, and the lowest being 3 LPA. Roughly one-third of students have B.Ed placed for package above 5 LPA, which amounts to 200 students. There is a significant increase in the placement rate from last year to this year. Around 40 companies have visited the campus, and they offer for associate engineer profile, but some of them have also offered marketing profile with a good package, like Byju's at 9 LPA. The students also have opportunities for doing the internship in the companies like Nvidia, NTT data, and get sponsorship for their BE project by companies such as BMC software and GS labs.
 
 Infrastructure: One of the aspects which needed to be improved in our college significantly is the infrastructure. The labs are excellent, and there isn't any lack of basic facilities, but there is nothing else apart from these facilities. There's a basketball court, 3-4 academic buildings, canteen and 2 hostels. The campus is small, 6 acres to be precise.
 
 Faculty: There is nothing much a college can do towards the curriculum when it comes to a particular University. But faculty for all the branches is very knowledgeable and great. They work hard for the betterment of the students. Various seminars and workshops are conducted for the students, and we get good industrial exposure through those. The attendance is taken very seriously and results are very good.
 
 Other: There are 2 tech fests each year in the college (credenza and CTD) and they are well known to all.

Harshal Suryawanshi | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2020,"The college is high on the placements, and low on the fun.
 
 Placements: PICT is doing well regarding the placements in Pune. It is one of the top grosser in Pune when you consider the placements offered. The highest package offered in the year 2016-17 was around 30 LPA, while the average pay was 8 LPA. The students get a lot of choices as many national and international firms come here for the placement drive throughout the year. From Morgan Stanley to TCS, the options are abundant for the students. The training and placement office of PICT takes a lot of efforts for preparing the students right from the first year. However, the one thing to note is that the students from E&TC branch have to take up the job in IT companies as no core companies come here.
 
 Infrastructure: PICT lacks the minimum infrastructure required for carrying out all the activities. The classrooms and the labs are apt, but it falls back regarding the sports facilities. We have only one basketball court and volleyball court on the campus. There is a small gym. The Wi-Fi speed is average, and it fails occasionally. The hostel rooms are good but strict. The canteen is big and serves limited options, but the quality is good.
 
 Faculty: The college follows Savitri Bai Phule Pune University. The faculty members are extremely professional and knowledgeable. A lot of the faculty members can't speak proper English. The strict staff is the norm at PICT. They want you to be perfect while doing the assignments and the stuff. It can be a torture for the students.
 
 Other: The events keep on going around the year in PICT. There are many student bodies/associations like ACM, PISB, ART CIRCLE, ROBOCON, TEDx NSS, and much more on the campus. So, you will always find some activity going on in the campus. The crowd is great. Most of them are nerds that sit around the campus and keep coding in their laptops.

Deep Dabare | B.E. in Information Technology - Batch of 2015,"An awesome university to get your degree from and secure a great position in the industry.
 
 Placements: The institute is known for its placement figures. It always has more than 90% of the placements with an average package of 3.5 - 4.5 LPA. Recently, big names in the industry have also shown up viz Siemens, and Zomato. Students from CSE and IT department are most likely to get placements in their fields. Just the EnTC students have to fight more for their specific companies.
 
 Infrastructure: The beauty of the college lies in its compact infrastructure. As the number of faculty members is only 3, the infrastructure is adequate to occupy that much. The library gets more importance due to the digital library concept acquired. The huge classrooms with projectors count the efficient teaching-learning process. Sports has special attention, and the campus also has fields dedicated to basketball, table tennis, chess, and carrom. A large parking space is there too.
 
 Faculty: The teachers present here are either enough or more than enough qualified for the courses they teach.

You get all the facilities related to the study and all. The college has no cricket ground. Only small basketball court and volleyball court are available. The classrooms are good but not having AC facility. The canteen food is average. The students mostly prefer outside food, as outside food of the college is delicious and you will have many options. The hostel is very good and silent, but one restriction for the hostel is you have to eat the canteen food mandatorily in the canteen itself if you're staying in the college hostel. The hostel fee is around Rs. 90 thousand per year, it's better not to stay in the college hostel. The library is awesome.

The highest salary offered was 36.0 LPA from a Japanese company Rakuten. Morgan Stanley and Barclays are among the top paying companies while Infosys and Accenture are among top recruiting companies.
 
 Infrastructure: The library of the college is decent. A Wi-Fi network is present in the library. Labs are also well-maintained. There is a high-speed Ethernet network present in a college giving speed up to 100 Mbps. The hostel accommodation is also quite good. Basic facilities like washrooms and a water purifier are present on every floor. The food quality is also good. The college lacks in sports. There is only one basketball and volleyball ground there.
 
 Faculty: The faculty team here is quite knowledgeable and experienced. The curriculum is strictly followed by the college. Right from attendance to lectures, everything is taken seriously. The faculty team encourages you to pursue knowledge apart from the syllabus.

Mahesh Somani | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2020,"Absolutely satisfied because of very good placements and faculty, the infrastructure doesn't matter
 
 Placements: The placement at PICT is at its best. The one of the best institute in Maharashtra according to the placement scenario. The placement for ENTC is the most in percentage than other branches in PICT but still, the ENTC students are unable to get higher value packages with respect to computer or IT students. For ENTC, the placement is about 80-85%.
 
 Infrastructure: The infrastructure of PICT is the only boring thing. The campus is too small in comparison with its reputation but still, it is able to provide all facilities except a big playground. The college has only a basketball court and a volleyball court. The gym at PICT is also not having enough facilities.
 
 Faculty: The faculty at PICT is best and trained. Every teacher has some experience before entering in PICT. Students get bored sometimes but the faculty members are like do all your work on time in the college only. These give advantages that need not require studies at home. The schedule is strictly followed by everyone in college. The teacher support when needed is more than sufficient. Other than the syllabus, many more things we get to learn from faculty members.
 
 Other: The senior support is very good. The college is far away from things like ragging and all. The crowd at PICT is must viewable during college days and #ADDICTION days. The students do not get bored because of the crowd at PICT and the silent, cool zone in the evening for walks.",2017-11-27,Shiksha,absolutely satisfied good placement faculty infrastructure doesnt matter placement placement pict best one best institute maharashtra according placement scenario placement entc percentage branch pict still entc student unable get higher value package respect computer student entc placement infrastructure infrastructure pict boring thing campus small comparison reputation still able provide facility except big playground college basketball court volleyball court gym pict also enough facility faculty faculty pict best trained every teacher experience entering pict student get bored sometimes faculty member like work time college give advantage need require study home schedule strictly followed everyone college teacher support needed sufficient syllabus many thing get learn faculty member senior support good college far away thing like ragging crowd pict must viewable college day addiction day student get bored crowd pict silent cool zone evening walk
Athang Mundada | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2020,"Small campus with a big heart!
 
 Placements: The placement scenario in PICT is quite good. Every year, big companies like Rakuten, Microsoft, Google visit the college. The average package is above 4 LPA, while the highest being more than 40 LPA every year. Currently, if you compare the placement scenario in PICT with other colleges in Pune, then you'll find that this college has got the best placements in the city.
 
 Infrastructure: The campus is really small. You can literally walk down the entire campus and not even feel a bit tired. The classrooms and labs are well-maintained with all the necessary equipment. In sports-wise, the college lags a lot. There is only one basketball court on the entire campus which is used for everything, besides basketball. The canteen also lags in quality, though you'll find a great and cheap food, near the college. The hostel rooms are also great, but its capacity is very less.
 
 Faculty: This college falls under Pune University. The faculty is excellent (the best under P.U. ). The professors are well-qualified with some of them graduating from top colleges in India.

Ankit Gupta | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2016,"A review on my engineering college.
 
 Placements: Only a few students from the college got placed in the top companies, while the rest were placed with smaller packages, in companies like TCS and Accenture in the range of about 5-6 lakhs per annum. The good companies that visited the college were Stanley Morgan, Rakuten, Barclays, Mu Sigma, and Symantec. The average package offered would be 6-7 lakhs per annum. The highest package offered, was by Rakuten of 36 lakhs per annum.
 
 Infrastructure: The college has a decent looking campus, although it was not that huge. There were computer labs, electronic labs, large classrooms, a library where you can study for the whole day. There were five floors in total, and the IT department was on the top floor. The computer science department and electronics department were connected within the building, through a passageway.
 
 Faculty: The faculty of this college are well-qualified, and they have a huge knowledge, which dwells into practicality. They are willing to impart knowledge, provided you are eager to learn.

Gaurav Padgilwar | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2014,"PICT is both heaven and hell. It's on you to select one of the sides.
 
 Placements: The placements, as well as the number of opportunities they provide, are good. If you make little efforts, you will get a placement for sure. For E&TC, the packages are not up to the mark but for other branches, they were very good. Around 40-50 companies visited the campus in 2014. I don't know what is the current status.
 
 Infrastructure: A small campus but it was up to the mark. But we had to compromise with sports. You would have to play every game on the basketball court. They didn't support much until we were in the final year. So if you have any aspiration for sports then it is not a good place to go.
 
 Faculty: Good faculty. The bad thing was the unproductive assignments they give. Some of them were very good and the rest were so-so. They just boasted about themselves.

Chinmay Chhajed | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2019,"Overall, good but too strict.
 
 Placements: 81% of the students who were there for placements got placed. More IT companies came to our college, so most of the E&TC students also get placed in IT companies. The highest package was given by Ittiam at around 8 LPA. Other companies with high packages were eQ Technologies, ThoughtWorks and FinIQ.
 
 Infrastructure: PICT has a small campus. There is a high-speed Wi-Fi connection which is accessible by students across campus. There is also a canteen and outside it a bakery shop where we can buy cakes to celebrate birthdays. There are a lot of shops outside to eat.
 
 Faculty: Currently, it follows Pune University's mentioned syllabus but soon, it will become autonomous. Here some faculty members are strict but most of them are lenient. They follow the rule of 75% attendance which is monitored strictly. Our H.O.D. is a knowledgeable person but he is also a bit strict.

Laykumar Patel | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2018,"A brief summary of life at PICT.
 
 Placements: Placements from PICT (name of the college in short) is something that attracts many students. The average salary of PICT is very good (around 4-5 LPA). Companies visiting campus are also multinational companies. There are a lot of chances of getting placed in a good company with a decent package. Rakuten is the highest paying company with a package of 35 LPA and the minimum package is offered by TCS at 3.5 LPA. The college does support and facilitate searching of internships but only allows third-year and final-year students to pursue these.
 
 Infrastructure: There are only 2 outdoor sports possible on the PICT campus- basketball and volleyball. PICT lacks space for sports i.e. the campus is small. But, what it lacks in space, it more than makes up for it with other facilities. There are boys and girls hostels on the campus which I will rate as better than most. Hostels are equipped with individual broadband connections in each room with very high-speed internet ( I've downloaded torrent files at 9.5 MBps). The whole college is connected by Wi-Fi but you have to register for using the college Wi-Fi. All the labs are well-equipped and all software labs are also connected via high-speed Internet. After the recent change in canteen catering, the PICT canteen serves one of the best canteen food I have had. There are lots of other options for eating as well.
 
 Faculty: My experience with faculty members was very good. There is like a little partition in the faculty. Some professors are young and have recently joined and the other group is of senior faculty members who have a minimum of 10 years of teaching experience. I would advise you not to misbehave with any of the faculty as it may affect your grades (in a negative way of the course). The student to faculty ratio is around 30:1. The faculty team is well-qualified and possesses ample knowledge to clarify all the doubts. The attendance is a major criteria at PICT. You need to maintain 75% attendance no matter what or else you will have to face quite a few troubles. Assignments are a curse for students. Each semester contains an unimaginable number of assignments. There are extra assignments as a form of punishment. But, in the end, it is all done for the students. Once you attend the lecture and complete the assignment, you don't need to study it again. PICT has a tie-up with many companies which have set up labs here to increase the industry exposure.",2017-07-21,Shiksha,brief summary life pict placement placement pict name college short something attracts many student average salary pict good around lpa company visiting campus also multinational company lot chance getting placed good company decent package rakuten highest paying company package lpa minimum package offered tc lpa college support facilitate searching internship allows thirdyear finalyear student pursue infrastructure outdoor sport possible pict campus basketball volleyball pict lack space sport ie campus small lack space make facility boy girl hostel campus rate better hostel equipped individual broadband connection room highspeed internet ive downloaded torrent file mbps whole college connected wifi register using college wifi lab wellequipped software lab also connected via highspeed internet recent change canteen catering pict canteen serf one best canteen food lot option eating well faculty experience faculty member good like little partition faculty professor young recently joined group senior faculty member minimum year teaching experience would advise misbehave faculty may affect grade negative way course student faculty ratio around faculty team wellqualified possesses ample knowledge clarify doubt attendance major criterion pict need maintain attendance matter else face quite trouble assignment curse student semester contains unimaginable number assignment extra assignment form punishment end done student attend lecture complete assignment dont need study pict tieup many company set lab increase industry exposure
Aditi Bobde | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2019,"Good in placements, great faculty, small campus, over strict.
 
 Placements: Most of the people get placed. In ENTC, placement packages are low because it's a core branch. So starting packages are low. But packages are high if one applies for coding & software jobs. Packages may vary from 3 lac to 30 lac & most of the crowd gets placed. The ones who aren't placed is mostly because they went for post graduation or didn't take a job intentionally.
 
 Infrastructure: The infrastructure isn't great. The college is small but it is clean, green & maintenance of the campus is great. There is a girls hostel & boys hostel & mess in the campus itself. Girls hostel is really great & same for boys' hostel. The mess is also good 'currently'. There is a basketball ground (not very large) on the campus. Labs & classrooms are well equipped & in really good condition.
 
 Faculty: The faculty is awesome is teaching terms although there are few exceptions, that's very rare. Teachers here have a great knowledge & the course curriculum is vast. It follows Pune University course curriculum. Teaching methodology is more like in schools. Nerds will love this place. There are 70-75 students in each class. We don't get much industry exposure here.
 
 Other: Over strictness. Sometimes you may feel like a jail. Attendance is compulsory. Not a place for creative people who focus more on practical knowledge than bookish. Boring.

 Placements: This year, the placements were overall good. Placements are usually divided into 2 categories- Group I) Above 5 LPA; Group II) Below 5 LPA. This year, the average salary for Group I was 8.23 LPA which included companies like Morgan Stanley, Avaya, Thought Works, Rakuten, etc. The average salary for group II was 3.54 LPA which included some mass recruiting companies like TCS, Accenture, L & T, etc. You can view the placement statistics in the official website of PICT i.e. http://pict.edu/placement/
 
 Infrastructure: PICT has got many facilities available in a very small campus. The campus is very small but has a cricket practice net, a gym, a volleyball court, basketball court, parking area, canteen, hostels, medical facilities, library and college buildings. Wi-Fi facility is available for students who have registered for the same by providing the MAC address of their devices. Each classroom is equipped with digital learning facilities and each Lab has around 25 computers with required software. Hostels are good. The library is well equipped with books. Digital library and reading halls are also present here.

They will help you in every way they can if you go with your problems to them. Each class has around 70 students in it. Teachers generally use digital presentations to teach.

Bhushan Parakh | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2015,"Best for computer science in Pune.
 
 Placements: The college placements are really commendable. Approximately 30-40 companies visit the campus. The average salary package is 5-6 lacs.

Chances are good for electronics and telecommunication students as well to get placed in IT companies.

The labs are well equipped with all the necessary facilities and the library has abundant books and reference material. The college has minimum facilities for sports and the hostel has limited entries.
 
 Faculty: The faculty members in all the 3 departments are good with the latest and practical knowledge of the technical subjects. The faculty members recommend reference books and also teach ftom those only. The practicals conducted by the professors are very helpful to cope up the theory part. The college is affiliated to Pune University and the curriculum is as per the guidelines of univerisity. But mind me, it's worth studying.

 Placements: The placements are always up to the mark. Most of the companies visited the campus in the first semester itself, the TPO and other staff members are very co-operative and concerned about the placements. The TP cell also provided a lot of interactive training sessions for students directly with the industry persons and HRs. This helped them in cracking the interview and getting their dream job.
 
 Infrastructure: The Wi-Fi facility is pretty good, each and every member of the college have been assigned with their UID and password for accessing internet services. The labs and classrooms are well maintained and are regularly cleaned on a daily basis. Sports and games in PICT have a bit of lower hand as more importance is given to academics.
 
 Faculty: The faculty teaching and non teaching as well is very co-operative and they are always up for the students. The teaching and assessment is also very good.

 Placements: PICT is famous for college placement. More than 50 companies come for the college placements. If you're technically sound, then definitely you'll get more than 5 lacs per annum CTC. No matter what your cgpa or percentage is, the only the thing that matters is your practical knowledge and your coding skills. Overall placement for my senior batch about more than 80%. All are placed in top MNCs. The highest package is of 36 lacs per annum by Rakuten Inc. The company hired about 18 students from my batch and the lowest is 2.6 lacs by Tech Mahindra. The average package is around 4 lacs per annum. I don't know all the company names but I'll mention some top companies- Rakuten, Amdocs, Thought Works, Nvidia, Symantec, IBM, TCS, Accenture, Cybage, Gslab, Morgan Stanley, Vuclip, Pubmatic, etc. Most of the students are assigned developer roles and few are assigned analyst roles. For internship, some will come to the college at the starting of the final year. L3cube is the best for internship and the stipend offered is around Rs. 20000, 5000, 2000, etc.
 
 Infrastructure: .As the college is famous for its placements only, you should not expect any facility regarding sports. The college is totally for studious students. All labs having 24Ã—7 LAN connectivity. Wi-Fi is also there. But in labs, all used the LAN facility for internet. Talking about the labs, all labs having proper systems. One lab assistant will be there for each lab, who helps in all concerns regarding the lab. The college library is not that big but as per the strength of college, it's good enough. It has 24Ã—7 Wi-Fi facility. The library is open from 8 am to 8 pm, and during exam time, it extends till 12. The quality of classrooms and labs is awesome. You'll be satisfied with the quality of the classrooms. Canteens are not that good. The same goes for hostel facility. The hostel is not value for money. The college has gym facility also where a trainer is available.

Rohit Barde | B.E. in Computer Engineering - Batch of 2019,"Not upto the expectations but the quality of students admitted are excellent.
 
 Placements: The placement was good compared to other university colleges of Maharashtra. Nearly 83% of the students got placed in different companies. The highest salary offered was 36 lacs PA with the lowest being 3.00 lacs PA and an average salary of around 7 lacs PA from 50 different companies that visited. Companies like Rakuten, Morgan Stanley, EQTechnologies, Avaya, Symantec etc visit the campus every year. Rakuten offered the highest salary of 36 lacs to 19 students from the college. Roles offered to students mainly includes the developer role and they were selected mostly on the basis of their BE project. Internship opportunities in this college are very low. There are strict rules for attendance and other assignments.
 
 Infrastructure: Facilities are very good. Computer labs are well-equipped with very high-speed Internet and with very good assistance. The sports facilities are the worst because the college is spread only in 5 acres of land so they have only a basketball court and each year, only an inter-college basketball tournament is held. The experience with the hostel is good but the canteen food is the worst. There are not much of options with the lack of management. I do not even remember going to canteen this year. There are not so many places to hangout because the whole place is concentrated with tall buildings, a basketball court and two hostels. Classrooms are conditioned and you always feel fresh while attending it.
 
 Faculty: The faculty team is good and supportive. Some of the new teachers are not yet experienced. Most of them have done PhDs in their subject but they lack in delivering it. Teaching methods are not very different from the regular teaching. But teachers always encourage us to learn out of the syllabus and do research on other things rather than just giving exams at each semester. Nearly 10-15% students opt for masters in the US from our college and we have a strong reputation in US universities.
 
 Other: Overall, a good college (except IITs) for those who really want to have a good job and go abroad for studies and can divert their minds from their usual hobbies.

Shubham Khedekar | B.E. in Computer Engineering - Batch of 2016,"Best of Placements, Faculty, Infrastructure makes every penny spent on PICT worth it.

Shirley Kotia | B.E. in Computer Engineering - Batch of 2017,"Good placements, infrastructure and social environment.
 
 Placements: The placements are pretty good. Maximum placement given is by Rakuten and is about 34 LPA. 80 to 90% people are usually placed at the end of the year. There are dream companies giving 10 to 30 LPA as well as mass recruiters giving 3 to 10 LPA. The roles offered are that of a software developer, quality analyst and data scientist. Internships are encouraged in the final year.
 
 Infrastructure: The Wi-Fi is pretty good but only for education purposes. Labs and classrooms are well-equipped. Sports is not encouraged that much. The library is good. The canteen is average but there are plenty of places to eat outside the campus. The hostel is well equipped but you have to compulsorily take canteen subscription which is bad and only 35 people are accommodated in the hostel.
 
 Faculty: The faculty is helpful in terms of academics. All of them are qualified and knowledgeable. They use PPTs and good teaching aids. The student-faculty ratio is 70:1. Industry exposure is very less. The course curriculum gives theoretical knowledge. Internships can be used for getting industry exposure but we need to manage college and internship together. No credits are given for that. A maximum of 25 days off will be granted for internship purposes.
 
 Other: All in all, it's a great college and you get to learn a lot. Placements are good and teachers are helpful. Keep good contact with your seniors for any help. They will guide you for the project related details and how to prepare for interviews.

Anagha Murtarkar | B.E. in Computer Engineering - Batch of 2018,"Satisfied because of faculty and good placements in previous years.
 
 Placements: In our previous batch i.e those who have completed their BE in 2016, 90% of students got placed. The highest package was 33 lakhs offered by Rakuten (Japanese company). The lowest package was around 3 lakhs. The average salary was 7 lakhs that year. Companies like Avaya, Morgan Stanley, Rakuten, Thoughtworks, Accenture, Sokrati, Persistent, TCS, ION, Pubmatic etc visit every year. But the percentage of placements is decreasing day by day. Also, internships were offered by NTT Data (Japan), IBM etc. The percentage of internships offers is increasing.
 
 Infrastructure: Wi-fi is only in the labs. You have to register for phones and laptops but no one usually does that. Classrooms, library are good. The campus is very small. Food in the canteen is not that good. Hostel rooms are quite good. You may not get that much exposure in sports and games. Overall campus is too small otherwise its good.
 
 Faculty: Some of the faculty members are very good and knowledgeable but at the same time, some have very less knowledge. The staff is quite strict compared to other colleges. They are very strict about the attendance. Ppts, video and lectures are given to explain a particular topic.

Anonymous | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2019,"The best college for computer engineering in Maharashtra in terms of education and placement, PICT.
 
 Placements: The placement is the best in PICT. This college is mostly known for its placement, and the maximum package offered for our college is 26 lacs offered by Rakuten Japan. Most students get the placement from the college, and the T&P cell of the college is the best. Many activities are organised by our college so that the students get placed to the company. Actually, our college starts preparing the students for placement right from the first year. Many programs are organised by the college to help the student to increase their vocabulary, mental aptitude and GD.
 
 Infrastructure: The infrastructure of PICT is well-maintained. Although the campus of our college is small, the feeling in the college is good because of the greenery. PICT does not have any big ground for its students but it has a basketball court and a volleyball ground. A small campus of our college contains 9 buildings ( including the canteen, girls' and boys' hostels). All are 4-7 floor buildings. The facility at the hostel is the best, but the canteen food is the worst. The college hostel is around 30 meters from the main building of our college.
 
 Faculty: Talking about faculty members, PICT has one of the best faculty members for CS, IT and ENTC. Every teacher here is very supportive and helps the students to decide what should be your choice after engineering. They make the students do their best. Although the faculty members here are very strict, it helps the students to understand the importance of the time management and how the company where they are gonna work after some year is going to make you work.
 
 Other: A student won't get enough opportunities to do something in sports. Here, the teachers are more interested in studies. Surely, they will tell you not to be the topper of the college but to acquire the knowledge which is required for the placement as bookish knowledge is not worth it in PICT.",2017-01-25,Shiksha,best college computer engineering maharashtra term education placement pict placement placement best pict college mostly known placement maximum package offered college lac offered rakuten japan student get placement college tp cell college best many activity organised college student get placed company actually college start preparing student placement right first year many program organised college help student increase vocabulary mental aptitude gd infrastructure infrastructure pict wellmaintained although campus college small feeling college good greenery pict big ground student basketball court volleyball ground small campus college contains building including canteen girl boy hostel floor building facility hostel best canteen food worst college hostel around meter main building college faculty talking faculty member pict one best faculty member c entc every teacher supportive help student decide choice engineering make student best although faculty member strict help student understand importance time management company gon na work year going make work student wont get enough opportunity something sport teacher interested study surely tell topper college acquire knowledge required placement bookish knowledge worth pict

 Placements: Placements are really great. Students have a chance to get a package as high as 34 lakhs in the Japanese company Rakuten. Most of the students get placed unlike other colleges. The placements have reduced considerably in the last few years. This year, the TPO has changed and we expect a significant increase in the placements. The overall placements are better than other colleges.
 
 Infrastructure: The infrastructure is very poor. Hardly 4-5 buildings are there and now there are 2 more buildings under construction. Classrooms are very poor and there are almost no labs. Sports facility is average and the campus is dirty. Classrooms are simple and don't have many facilities.
 
 Faculty: The college has great courses. It has very strict teachers. They are even stricter than schools. Also, there are a lot of rules. There is a pathetic attendance policy and the college takes fine for not attending classes. The teachers are average. Some of them are good and some poor, but they are all helpful.

 Placements: The placements are really good if you want to go in the computer or IT field. But if you are looking for core electronic companies, then your are at the wrong place as most of the A-lister companies that visit are computer-based or IT companies. The best company that visited is a Japanese company offering you a package of around 40 lacs.
 
 Infrastructure: The infrastructure is fine as our college has only three departments, but the campus is really small. The Wi-Fi facility is good but to get your username, you have to work really hard. The library is fine you as get all the books you need and you can issue it for one week. You can issue three books at a time and if you are in final year, you can have four books for two weeks. The sports and games facility are not that good as our college lacks in the infrastructure.
 
 Faculty: The faculty team is really good at teaching, but they are very strict about the attendance. The practicals and classes are conducted very well, but you have to really work hard during the submission time as they are really strict about checking your manuals and especially if you are in the electronics department, where you have to attend all the practicals.

 Placements: Out of all the fine aspects this college has to offer, the placements stand out the most and is exceptional. Many prestigious companies set foot on the college grounds for their recruitment process, and a very good percentage of students get placed with respectable package deals.
 
 Infrastructure: Infrastructure-wise, the college is very substandard. The college was established in 1983, and very few modifications and improvements have been made to the campus since then. Academic facilities like labs, library, electronic equipment and computers are adequate, but the college lacks other facilities like sports, cultural and extracurricular activities.

Shivani G | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2020,"Our college provides a lot of placement opportunities and less infrastructure.
 
 Placements: Our college provides a lot of placement opportunities. Placements are a little tough for ENTC students because there are few core companies. But as most of the students want to go to IT companies, our college provides great opportunities for them. A lot of companies visit our college for placements so you will get plenty of chances.
 
 Infrastructure: The college is not that huge. Classrooms have projectors. Wi-Fi facility is available here, but the range is not there in most of the areas. There is a huge problem with the speed of the Wi-Fi facility. So if you want to do major work, then you must have your own data connection.

 Placements: Overall the placement of the college is very good but when it comes to ENTC only 50% of the students get placed due to the lack of skills which they should have had if college have paid attention to it rather than just completing the syllabus. Other branches have very good placements.
 
 Infrastructure: College has a very compact campus, doesn't even have a proper playground. Canteen provides very poor quality food and prices are too dam high. College provides better facilities when it comes to the learning. It has very small library only containing course related books, no room for other genres.
 
 Faculty: ENTC has the worst faculty as compared to other branches only focusing on the syllabus not considering required skills students needs. Other faculty members of college are pretty good.

Anonymous | B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering - Batch of 2021,"Decent college, overall good faculty, poor infrastructure and labs.
 
 Placements: Placements for the Electronics and Telecommunication department is in not a very good state. There is only one core company that visits for placements and also pay very less, as compared to IT companies. As a result, an EnTC graduate spends 3 years in the EnTC department only to get a job that does not require any EnTC skill or knowledge. Moreover, companies prefer recruiting Computer Science and IT students because they are studying relevant subjects in their course. Hence, for an EnTC student to get a job requires a lot of time and effort to be focused on enhancing their coding skills.
 
 Infrastructure: The infrastructure is not upto the mark. Classrooms are pretty old and the benches are usually not in a good state, making sitting through lectures extremely uncomfortable. The same goes for labs. The equipment is old and outdated. Many a times lab equipments to perform the experiment are faulty and puts you in a soup during final practical exams in front of the external when you just can't get it to work. College Wi-Fi is poor, you simply cannot get reception anywhere within the campus other than in the library. In the event that you get connected to the Wi-Fi, you'll be lucky if you can download a 10mb file in less than an hour.
 
 Faculty: The course curriculum is old and outdated. Just like every other college, PICT places strict regulations on submitting assignments and maintaining a high attendance. Faculty in the EnTC department is a mixed bag. You have exceptionally great professors and you have quite a few not so good professors. The faculty for the first shift is much better (in the EnTC department) and the difference is definitely noticeable when you compare the two. There are a few professors in the second shift who just want to trouble the students.
 
 Other: There are three technical fests organized in the college and one cultural fest. The college must improve the quality of faculty and the labs need a major update. This course is difficult, go for this course if you're strong in mathematics.",2020-06-12,Shiksha,decent college overall good faculty poor infrastructure lab placement placement electronics telecommunication department good state one core company visit placement also pay less compared company result entc graduate spends year entc department get job require entc skill knowledge moreover company prefer recruiting computer science student studying relevant subject course hence entc student get job requires lot time effort focused enhancing coding skill infrastructure infrastructure upto mark classroom pretty old bench usually good state making sitting lecture extremely uncomfortable go lab equipment old outdated many time lab equipment perform experiment faulty put soup final practical exam front external cant get work college wifi poor simply get reception anywhere within campus library event get connected wifi youll lucky download mb file less hour faculty course curriculum old outdated like every college pict place strict regulation submitting assignment maintaining high attendance faculty entc department mixed bag exceptionally great professor quite good professor faculty first shift much better entc department difference definitely noticeable compare two professor second shift want trouble student three technical fests organized college one cultural fest college must improve quality faculty lab need major update course difficult go course youre strong mathematics

They are there just like your family members, they will guide you at every moment you need them. Bad aspects: 1) Pict is very strict when it comes to academics. 2) Pict do not follow many internships means they do not provide many holidays for internships(1month regularly).

The cutoffs are really high almost 99 percentile for IT and CS branch (for general) and for entc it is above 95 percentile.

Siddharth Pramod Pawar,"Overall: Pict is the best college for the students who are looking for the great opportunities in internships and placements. According to me Pict lies in the top 10 colleges in Maharashtra state. I choosed this college because the college is based in the pune which is also a IT hub and a lot of companies recruit from here.
 
 Placement: Placements and the internships are the only reason which brought me towards this college. This college is situated in pune which is also IT hub of Maharashtra. So every company that recruits from Maharashtra recruits from PICT pune. Placements opportunities are top notch at this college. The percentage of students placed last year was around 90% which is great for state level college.
 
 Infrastructure: Infrastructure of this college is descent. It is not that great because of the small campus area. Like it is only 5 acres of college. Colleges size is small so that's why do not have lots of places to explore in the college. As compared to other engineering colleges infrastructure is not that well over here.
 
 Faculty: I personally think at the time of entering the engineering colleges you should not be depend upon the faculty. Students only attend the classes to maintain that criteria of 75% in college. Otherwise the lectures are not that interesting. Faculty is not that major factor. But the faculty over here is pretty descent. If you will attend regular classes and have the written notes then the semester exam will be piece of cake for you.
 
 Hostel: Total intake of college for BTech students is around 3000-4000 and only 300-400 students gets hostel. So you might have to hunt for the flats or you can also live in PG with your college friends. I did not applied for hostel. I was living in flat with some of batchmates, which also not that great idea. Because you have to take care of the flat then which is a pain again.",2021-07-25,CollegeDheko,overall pict best college student looking great opportunity internship placement according pict lie top college maharashtra state choosed college college based pune also hub lot company recruit placement placement internship reason brought towards college college situated pune also hub maharashtra every company recruit maharashtra recruit pict pune placement opportunity top notch college percentage student placed last year around great state level college infrastructure infrastructure college descent great small campus area like acre college college size small thats lot place explore college compared engineering college infrastructure well faculty personally think time entering engineering college depend upon faculty student attend class maintain criterion college otherwise lecture interesting faculty major factor faculty pretty descent attend regular class written note semester exam piece cake hostel total intake college btech student around student get hostel might hunt flat also live pg college friend applied hostel living flat batchmates also great idea take care flat pain

 The lady teachers(IT) just freaking boss around and mess you up for small mistakes and frustrate you for no reason. Like they are there for just checking not teaching. Ofc you have your flaws at the end of the day. But PICT should rethink how they treat students.
 
 I'll say learn more about business, sales, marketing, what's going on there in the world because the world in the pict is very very small.
 
 Enjoy the events, parties, talks with seniors.

KALYANA SUNDARAM,"Won't recommend this college at all. My respectful opinion is that this college is a jail wherein students or faculty need gatepasses to go out unlike other colleges around. Open learning atmosphere may not occur at all. No industry exposure occurs. Students are not taken by the departments to see all types of engineering industries. Admissions department customer service to parents is very poor. An absence of Parking space and other facilities gives a feeling of lack of infrastructure. Students are not treated well and medical help /facilities on campus need to be present for an emergency. Psychological Counsellors for students are not present. First year Engineer workshop is pathetic. No decent playtime shown in the timetable.. And you will rarely if ever see this college practice sports or dance or dramatics. Therefore Overall development of the student is possibly absent. Very little time or effort is displayed as to how Faculty never spend time for slow learners. ( Nobody answers this anyway) If your child is creative ( not a book worm) and has a higher IQ AsKS questions , or Logically sound choose some other institution.

Ajinkya Bobade,"from ENTC perspective
 First year is awesome well known professors but after that the syllabus is static and becomes stressful also very little space for recreation, placements are good for two branches but worst for the third , hardly 1 to 2 entc core companies visit the campus for recruitment , many professors have good knowledge of the subject they really encourage students to do research and go for higher education but a handful are mental frustration with no respect for students and are source of discouragement , pict makes basic understanding in electronics and telecommunication clear and 4 year at pict will definitely prepare you for your master of science degree ahed, if you are planning for doing MS then PICT is THE BEST COLLEGE FOR YOU . but if you are thinking of setting on job then for electronics and telecommunication students they will end up studying gates and flip-flops working day and night to get first class but after 4 year you will end up in C and JAVA and all programming stuff which makes no sense .

Sachin Potdar,"I am x student of this college passed out in 1994. I also agree to the comments given by some students saying that only expectations from student like 100% attendence, every thing perfect they want and all. But let me tell you that the college is not having teaching quality, they only expect from students without proper coaching. They were (and seems to be are) not having proper staff, teachers to teach. I will give example of professor Dr. Gurjar who was teacher for us for Fortran, applied physics and SOM. But he never taught these subjects in class. Maximum attedence in his class was 2 digits i.e. max 9 students. So in viva, he was just failing students giving reason that no attendence in class. But he never thoughts that why students don't come to his class or lectur? Actually it is his fault. This was and seems to be is environment till now. Professor like Uday Joshi, Sarang Joshi were just putting last date of submission of lab assignments on the board. When asked about any difficulty, they were not guiding at all. How they will guide? To guide a student, the teacher should have mastery on subject na? I don't know who has given PHD to Sarang Joshi, that person must be big donkey. Sarang Joshi is still professor in PICT.
 
 At that time people from BV were calling this college as PICT (People In Continuous Trouble). And it is true.. Teahers in this college were glad to trouble students rather than teaching/guiding them as they themselves don't have knowledge to teach.
